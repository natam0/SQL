-- In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

-- 1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND Product = 'iPhone';

-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6;

-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

-- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity) * price Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
GROUP BY Product;

-- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Quantity, price, price*Quantity Revenue, location    /* I left in location and individual price do double check myself*/
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

-- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price) AvgSpent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE Quantity > 2 AND length(orderID) = 6;
