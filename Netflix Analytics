-- In this code I am querying a database of Netflix information using PostgreSQL to answer questions about the data.

#1. How many movie titles are in the database? (movie titles, not tv show titles)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all of the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

#4. Who was the director of the movie Bright Star? (I returned both the title of the movie and director)
SELECT people.director, titles.title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT OUTER JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest ovie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY release_year LIMIT 1;
